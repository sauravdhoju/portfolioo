 * @description Dark theme colors.
 *
 * What each color represents:
 * ------------------------------------------
 * $primary: Represents the primary color used throughout the theme.
 * $secondary: Represents the secondary color used for accents. It should be something neutral like gray or a soft white.
 * $dark: Used for dark accents. Some examples where it's used are: the contact form attachment icon and the contact options icon background.
 * $danger: Used for error messages (for example, when you try to submit a contact form with a message less than 4 words).
 * $muted: Used for muted text that should not draw much attention, such as the page title prefix.
 *
 * $base-bg: The background color.
 * $base-bg-light: A lighter version of the background color, only used for the light animation circles.
 * $base-bg-dark: A darker version of the background color, used for the dark animation circles.
 *
 * $texts: The main text color.
 * $texts-inverted: The inverted text color. For example, if your text color is white, this should be black.
 *
 * $base-container-bg: The background color for the sidebar and the main section container.
 * $base-popover-bg: The standard background color for popovers, such as the language picker.
 * $base-boards: The standard background color for containers inside the section, such as timeline items, cards, info list items, etc.
 * $base-info-badges: The base color for badges, such as the date badge in the timeline.
 * $empty: The color used for fillable containers, such as the contact form fields or the progress bar background, for example.
 * $empty-accent: The accent color for empty containers. This one is used for inactive elements on the mobile navigation items.
 *
 * $borders: The default border color. For example, the color of the borders around the navigation sidebar items.
 * $scrollbar-track: The background color of the scrollbar track.
 * $scrollbar-thumb: The color of the scrollbar thumb.
